# THIS IS NOT GOOD EXAMPLE CODE
### Christ, its partially commented, highly repeative, poorly written, and doesnt even follow its own naming conventions


If you want an actual dive into this. Heres how it works:

1. script reads all files from a folder on my laptop
2. it figures out what program you edited your spreadsheets on
  - this one probably only applies to me, since I use an alternative to excel.
3. it searches all the files and collects relevent information
  - this includes each persons row. 
  - the files themselves ask who you are, this is for debugging purposes to make sure errors arent triggered wrongly (promise not to look at them and they wont be posted here.
4. each row is formatted into a "standard class" to be handled
  - these are technically seperated into leaders and members (not the naming scheme tho)
5. all entries are sorted into a main dictonary, which holds an entry for each person, and then each persons 4 scores and the comments
6. it averages out all of that overwhelming number stuff, putting in it a new spreadsheet, with a collection of comments file for each person (so you dont have to share it out loud).
