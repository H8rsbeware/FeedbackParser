# Totally Ingenious Tallying System
Do your teammates seem like they're slacking? Is there a rift between them, causing friction? Are they switching tabs as soon as you approach them? Wouldn't you rather have them staring at TITS? Introducing, **The Totally Ingenious Tallying System** (T.I.T.S), its is a way to keep your team focused and working efficiently together.

By having team members ~~snitch~~ report on the work and attitudes of others, they can clearly see any faults and areas for improvement. 

The system comes with some unique perks:
- Anonymised feedback so users can't see who ~~ratted them out~~ rated them or how
- Generalised scores for the team mean that the focus is on how **everyone** can improve together as a whole, and not just singling out a poor slacker.
- Feedback is fed back into a formatted document that can be customised to suit your needs, whether for at-a-glance comprehension or in-depth review
- Compiled reports over time provide automated statistical analysis of your team's ability to work together.

Ingenious is wrapped up in a tidy, modern GUI providing easy access and installation for your team. Customizability is simple and streamlined, allowing you to get relevant, targeted feedback fast from your team and for you to generate those reports instantly.
